Currently at commit:64dc6d13cc4f133d272759d9ed9ea9db1cd10456

In order to learn more about Arma 3 scripting in general I'll be heavily commenting the code
as I follow it through. I've added links to the relevent BI wiki pages where I hit a command or
feature that I've not known so it should be easy to reference stuff as a scripting newbie.
All comments I add are marked: //MD- for ease of identification of what I've added.

I've added a file to the root directory called orderofexe.txt that shows (as far I can currently discern)
the structure of the mod in relation to the order in which scripts are referenced. This is probably as good 
a place as any to start.

I can be contacted on the ZombieSkelper.com forum (theirongiant).
