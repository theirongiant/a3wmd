Order of Execution
------------------

This lists a rough order of execution (inclusion might be a better term). Each level of indention shows the scripts that
are referenced by the parent. One's starting with '>' are ones I've checked through manually. It's not entirely accurate as
some of the client/items init scripts don't directly reference all the scripts in the folder but I'm presuming that the actions
pull them in but it made sense to list the under the init scripts currently
